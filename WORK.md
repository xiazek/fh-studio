Hey Maciej! 

First, I am deeply sorry to contact you in this wierd way. Unfortunetely, it was the only option I found. ODesk wanted me to post a Job Description and your email is not public on github. Again, sorry for that. You should obviously not merge this into your branch :)

My name is Eugene and I am CTO of Aion - a small company specializing in democratic infrastructure here in Denmark. Our primary customers are civil society organizations, municipalities and government organizations. Here is our website: http://www.assemblyvoting.dk/en/

While surfing ODesk this morning, I came across your profile and I must say that your portfolio put a smile on my face! As you might know, Denmark is a small country and demand for great web developers here is huge. Unfortunately, I was not able to find anyone available with a passion for web, that I personally strive for. So I turned to ODesk and remote contractors - and found you.

Now here is the list of some Rails sites for our customers:

http://dc.roskilde-festival.dk/
http://brohuset-orestad.dk/
http://folket.valgservice.dk/
https://dm.valglister.dk/

Take a look and tell me if we could discuss the possibility of working together.

Some more technical info:

Tools and services we use: GIT as our VCS, EC2 and Linode for hosting. Mysql is our database.
Tests are done with RSpec + factory girl instead of fixtures. Capybara for integration tests.
Organizational tools: Redmine, Basecamp, Skype.

Gems we use:
* Devise for authentication (with omniauth-facebook when Facebook Connect is needed)
* CanCan for ACL
* Carrierwave for file uploads,
* rails_config for general app configuration
* activeadmin for admin interfaces
plus a bunch of other, smaller ones

None of this is set in stone, so don't worry if you don't know some of it. We are a very flat, agile organization and if you can argument for a tool that is not on the list - we would love to switch to that or add it into our toolbox. 

Again, sorry for the pull request.
